\title{Vocabulary growth data}
\description{
Data from the Laboratory School of the University  of Chicago.  
They consist of scores from a cohort of pupils in grades 8-11 on
the vocabulary section of the Cooperative Reading Test.  The
scores are scaled to a common, but arbitrary origin and unit
of measurement, so as to be comparable over the four grades.

}
\usage{data(VocabGrowth)}
\format{
  A data frame with 64 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{grade8}}{Grade 8 vocabulary score}
    \item{\code{grade9}}{Grade 9 vocabulary score}
    \item{\code{grade10}}{Grade 10 vocabulary score}
    \item{\code{grade11}}{Grade 11 vocabulary score}
  }
}
\details{
Since these data cover an age range in which physical growth
is beginning to decelerate, it is of interest whether a
similar effect occurs in the acquisition of new vocabulary.
