\description{
 School Data, from Charnes et al. (1981). The aim is to explain scores on 3 
different tests, \code{reading}, \code{mathematics} and \code{selfesteem}
from 70 school sites by means of 5 explanatory variables.

}
\usage{data(schooldata)}
\format{
  A data frame with 70 observations on the following 8 variables.

\describe{
\item{\code{education}}{ education level of mother as measured in terms of percentage of high school 
graduates among female parents}
\item{\code{occupation}}{ highest occupation of a family member according to a pre-arranged rating scale}
\item{\code{visit}}{ parental visits index representing the number of visits to the school site}
\item{\code{counseling}}{ parent counseling index calculated from data on time spent with child on 
school-related topics such as reading together, etc.}
\item{\code{teacher}}{ number of teachers at a given site}
\item{\code{reading}}{ total reading score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test}
\item{\code{mathematics}}{ total mathematics score as measured by the Metropolitan Achievement Test}
\item{\code{selfesteem}}{ Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, intended as a measure of self-esteem}
} 
}
\details{
This dataset was shamelessly borrowed from the \code{FRB} package.

The relationships among these variables are unusual, a fact only revealed by plotting.
