\title{Draw a 3D cross in an rgl scene}
\description{
  Draws a 3D cross or axis vectors in an rgl scene.

\usage{
cross3d(centre = rep(0, 3), scale = rep(1, 3), ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{centre}{A scalar or vector of length 3, giving the centre of the 3D cross}
  \item{scale}{ A scalar or vector of length 3, giving the lengths of the arms of the 3D cross}
  \item{\dots}{Other arguments, passed on to \code{\link[rgl]{segments3d}}}

\value{
