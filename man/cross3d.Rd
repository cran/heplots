\title{Draw a 3D cross in an rgl scene}
\usage{
cross3d(centre = rep(0, 3), scale = rep(1, 3), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{centre}{A scalar or vector of length 3, giving the centre of the 3D cross}

\item{scale}{A scalar or vector of length 3, giving the lengths of the arms of the 3D cross}

\item{\dots}{Other arguments, passed on to \code{\link[rgl]{segments3d}}}
}
\value{
Used for its side-effect, but returns (invisibly) a 6 by 3 matrix
       containing the end-points of three axes, in pairs.
