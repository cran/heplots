\title{
Head measurements of football players
}
\description{
Data collected as part of a preliminary study examining the
relation between football helmet design and neck injuries.
There are 30 subjects in each of three groups:
High school football players, college players and non-football players.

\usage{data(FootHead)}
\format{
  A data frame with 90 observations on the following 7 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{group}}{a factor with levels \code{High school} \code{College} \code{Non-football}}
